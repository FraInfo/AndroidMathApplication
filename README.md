# AndroidMathApplication
School project. 

Android Java Application which contains some Java school projects classes: 
  -Numerical Computation algorithms for compute the zero of function with Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant and Chords methods; 
  -Compute of PI Greco's value with Monte Carlo method; 
  -Compute of function's subtended area with Monte Carlo method.

Implementation of Combined Chart and Math Parser for compute the function inserted from the input.

Is possible to:
  - Insert a function from input and see it on Line Chart.
